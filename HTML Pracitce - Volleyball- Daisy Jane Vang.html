        <h1>Volleyball</h1>
        <p>Playing Volleyball is fun, but I now only play when I'm practicing with my younger sister. But there are some key things when you do plan on playing or even practicing volleyball.</p>

 <h2>Practice</h2>
    <P>Practice helps with being able to make recieves and serves over the net. Recieves and serves won't always make it. And that's okay. With practicing you'll make it over eventually, just never give up on what you're doing.</P>

  <h2>Lists of Equipment and Benefits</h2>

       <p>When playing volleyball there are many benefits included, such as:</p>

    <ul>
            <li>Hand and eye coordination</li>
            <li>Reaction time</li>
            <li>Accuracy</li>
     </ul>

<p>When you play Volleyball, you need equipment such as:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Knee pads</li>
    <li>Your own volleyball to practice with.</li>
    <li>Your own volleyball net for practice when there isn't a net available.</li>
    <li>Volleyball tape, for when your fingers are hurting.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Streching is Key</h2>

<p><em>Before playing</em>, you need to make sure that your body is perfectly warmed up for practice or the match that is happening.</p>
<p>When you <strong>don't</strong> stretch, it could lead to serious injuries. Two injuries you could face when you don't stretch before playing is tearing a part of your upper arm or hurting your risk when spiking.</p>
<p>When you <strong>stretch</strong> it gets your muscles to relax. So when you are playing you will be flexiable enough to do the practices without injuring yourself.</p>
